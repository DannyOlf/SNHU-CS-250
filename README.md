How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Ideally, I interpret user needs by talking to the user and trying understand what it they are trying to do. User stories really help by making keeping the probelm in focus, instead of focusing on the solution. It also keeps things simply so things do not get lost in technical documentation. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I try to make a list of things that the progam needs to do (a product/sprint backlog of sorts). From there I try to figure out best to reach that goal, and if need be I refer to the user stories to rethink my approch. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that being a good team member is more than just being good at your job. Communication skills will make a team run far smoother than anything else I can think of.
